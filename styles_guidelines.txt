Overall Look:
-Minimalist, calming
-Optimistic
The product deals touches on subjects like pollution, waste and climate change. The product aims to help with these issues, which means the website
should reflect the optimistic and uplifting nature of CleanUp. A chaotic look can be 'aggressive', which contradicts the 'calmness'.

Coloration:
Blue is the main colour, with a highlight colour of orange. Blue not only matches the calming demeanor, it gives the page 
an oceanic theme which is relative because the product deals with waste and plastics.
Orange is a contrasting colour to blue, and thus serves as a powerful highlight to draw attention to important parts of the website.

Typography:
Minimalist, not too formal nor to unprofessional. "Happy" letters that don't give off strong emotion or intensity. The point is to give the user a positive,
soothing experience.
-LUCIDA SANS for non-headers
-CORBEL for headers and other important text
