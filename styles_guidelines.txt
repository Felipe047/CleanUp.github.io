Overall Look:
-Minimalist, calming
-Optimistic

Coloration:
Blue is the main colour, with a highlight colour of orange. Blue not only matches the calming demeanor, it gives the page 
an oceanic theme which is relative because the product deals with waste.
Orange is a contrasting colour to blue, and thus serves as a powerful highlight.

Typography:
Minimalist, not too formal nor to unprofessional. Happy letters that don't give off strong emotion or intensity.
