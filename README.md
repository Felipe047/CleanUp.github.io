# Clean Up
Clean Up helps you detect and control your overall plastic waste consumption.

It's a smart tool that allows you to have a transparent understanding of what goes into the products you consume daily.\
This application has various features: 
- Take the items you buy and show the types of plastic within the product.
- Analyzes the CO2 emissions.
- Detects the amount of plastic you're consuming within that one product.
- Tells you the best way to dispose of that product.
