Description: 
Syros Riff: This tool helps you detect and control your overall plastic waste consumption.
It's a smart tool that allows you to have a transparent understanding of what goes into the 
products you consume daily. This application has various features: It takes the items
you buy and shows the types of plastic within the protection, analyzes the CO2 emissions,
detects the amount of plastic you're consuming within that one product, and tells you the best way to dispose of that product.
